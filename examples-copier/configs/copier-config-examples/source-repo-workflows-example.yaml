# ============================================================================
# BENEFITS OF THIS STRUCTURE
# ============================================================================
#
# 1. CO-LOCATION
#    - Workflow config lives with source code
#    - Easy to find and update
#    - Version controlled with source
#
# 2. OWNERSHIP
#    - Source repo team owns the workflow config
#    - Can update without touching central config
#    - Clear responsibility
#
# 3. TESTING
#    - Can test workflow config changes in source repo
#    - PR reviews include workflow changes
#    - Easy to validate before merging
#
# 4. SCALABILITY
#    - Each source repo has its own config
#    - No central bottleneck
#    - Easy to add new workflows
#
# 5. AUTOMATIC CONTEXT INFERENCE
#    - No need to specify source.repo and source.branch in workflows
#    - Automatically inherited from the workflow config reference
#    - Less redundancy, cleaner configuration
#    - Can still override if needed (e.g., different branch)
#
# ============================================================================
# SOURCE CONTEXT INFERENCE
# ============================================================================
#
# When a workflow config is referenced from a source repo, workflows can omit
# source.repo and source.branch - they're automatically inferred!
#
# EXAMPLE 1: Fully inferred (most common)
#   - name: "my-workflow"
#     # source.repo and source.branch inherited from workflow config reference
#     destination:
#       repo: "mongodb/dest-repo"
#     transformations:
#       - move: { from: "src", to: "dest" }
#
# EXAMPLE 2: Override branch only
#   - name: "my-workflow-develop"
#     source:
#       branch: "develop"  # Override branch, repo still inferred
#     destination:
#       repo: "mongodb/dest-repo"
#     transformations:
#       - move: { from: "src", to: "dest" }
#
# EXAMPLE 3: Explicit source (if needed)
#   - name: "cross-repo-workflow"
#     source:
#       repo: "mongodb/other-repo"  # Explicitly specify different repo
#       branch: "main"
#     destination:
#       repo: "mongodb/dest-repo"
#     transformations:
#       - move: { from: "src", to: "dest" }
#
# ============================================================================
# USING REFERENCES FOR REUSABILITY
# ============================================================================
#
# For even better organization, you can extract common parts into separate files:
#
# .copier/
#   workflows.yaml                    # This file (references others)
#   transformations/
#     mflix-java.yaml                 # Java transformations
#     mflix-nodejs.yaml               # Node.js transformations
#     mflix-python.yaml               # Python transformations
#   strategies/
#     mflix-pr-strategy.yaml          # Common PR strategy
#   common/
#     mflix-excludes.yaml             # Common exclude patterns
#
# Then use $ref to reference them:
#
# workflows:
#   - name: "mflix-java"
#     # source.repo and source.branch inherited from workflow config reference
#     destination:
#       repo: "mongodb/sample-app-java-mflix"
#       branch: "main"
#     transformations:
#       $ref: "transformations/mflix-java.yaml"
#     commit_strategy:
#       $ref: "strategies/mflix-pr-strategy.yaml"
#
# ============================================================================
# ADDING A NEW WORKFLOW
# ============================================================================
#
# To add a new workflow to this source repo:
#
# 1. Add a new workflow entry to this file
# 2. Define destination and transformations
# 3. Optionally override commit strategy
# 4. Commit and push to source repo
# 5. No changes needed to main config!
#
# Example (with source context inference):
#
# - name: "new-app-java"
#   # source.repo and source.branch inherited automatically
#   destination:
#     repo: "mongodb/sample-app-java-newapp"
#     branch: "main"
#   transformations:
#     - move: { from: "newapp/client", to: "client" }
#     - move: { from: "newapp/server/java", to: "server" }
#
# ============================================================================
# TESTING WORKFLOW CONFIGS
# ============================================================================
#
# You can test workflow configs locally before deploying:
#
# 1. Create a test config file
# 2. Use DRY_RUN=true to test without making changes
# 3. Validate transformations work as expected
# 4. Check PR titles and bodies
#
