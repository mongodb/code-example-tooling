# Multi-Source Repository Support - Implementation Summary

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the multi-source repository support implementation plan for the examples-copier application.

## What's Being Built

The multi-source feature enables the examples-copier to monitor and process webhooks from **multiple source repositories** in a single deployment, eliminating the need for separate copier instances.

### Current State
- âœ… Single source repository per deployment
- âœ… Hardcoded repository configuration
- âœ… One GitHub App installation per instance
- âœ… Manual deployment for each source

### Future State
- ðŸŽ¯ Multiple source repositories per deployment
- ðŸŽ¯ Dynamic webhook routing
- ðŸŽ¯ Multiple GitHub App installations
- ðŸŽ¯ Centralized configuration management
- ðŸŽ¯ Per-source metrics and monitoring

## Key Benefits

1. **Simplified Operations**: One deployment handles all source repositories
2. **Cost Reduction**: Shared infrastructure reduces hosting costs
3. **Easier Maintenance**: Single codebase and configuration to manage
4. **Better Observability**: Unified metrics and audit logging
5. **Scalability**: Easy to add new source repositories

   - Switches between installations per source

4. **Metrics Collector** (Enhanced)
   - Tracks metrics per source repository

## Configuration Schema

### Multi-Source Format

```yaml
sources:
  - repo: "mongodb/docs-code-examples"
    branch: "main"
    installation_id: "12345678"  # Optional
    copy_rules:
      - name: "go-examples"
        source_pattern:
          type: "prefix"
          pattern: "examples/go/"
        targets:
          - repo: "mongodb/docs"
            branch: "main"
            path_transform: "code/go/${path}"
            commit_strategy:
              type: "pull_request"
              pr_title: "Update Go examples"
              auto_merge: false

  - repo: "mongodb/atlas-examples"
    branch: "main"
    installation_id: "87654321"
    copy_rules:
      # ... additional rules

defaults:
  commit_strategy:
    type: "pull_request"
    auto_merge: false
  deprecation_check:
    enabled: true
```

### Backward Compatibility

The system automatically detects and supports the legacy single-source format:

```yaml
# Legacy format - still works!
source_repo: "mongodb/docs-code-examples"
source_branch: "main"
copy_rules:
  - name: "example"
    # ... rules
```

## Implementation Phases

## Key Features

### 1. Automatic Source Detection
The webhook router automatically identifies the source repository from incoming webhooks and routes to the appropriate configuration.

### 2. Installation Management
Seamlessly switches between GitHub App installations for different organizations, with automatic token caching and refresh.

### 3. Per-Source Metrics
Track webhooks, files, and operations separately for each source repository:

```json
{
  "by_source": {
    "mongodb/docs-code-examples": {
      "webhooks": {"received": 100, "processed": 98},
      "files": {"matched": 200, "uploaded": 195}
    },
    "mongodb/atlas-examples": {
      "webhooks": {"received": 50, "processed": 47},
      "files": {"matched": 120, "uploaded": 115}
    }
  }
}
```

### 4. Flexible Configuration
Support for:
- Centralized configuration (all sources in one file)
- Distributed configuration (config per source repo)
- Global defaults with per-source overrides
- Cross-organization copying

### 5. Enhanced Monitoring
- Health endpoint shows status per source
- Metrics endpoint provides per-source breakdown
- Audit logs include source repository context
- Slack notifications with source information

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Configuration loading and validation
- Webhook routing logic
- Installation token management
- Metrics collection per source

### Integration Tests
- Multi-source webhook processing
- Installation switching
- Config format conversion
- Error handling scenarios

### End-to-End Tests
- Complete workflow with 3+ sources
- Cross-organization copying
- Failure recovery
- Performance under load

## Deployment Strategy

### Rollout Approach
1. Deploy with backward compatibility enabled
2. Test in staging with multi-source config
3. Gradual production rollout (canary deployment)
4. Monitor metrics and logs closely
5. Full production deployment
6. Decommission old single-source deployments

### Monitoring During Rollout
- Track webhook success rates per source
- Monitor GitHub API rate limits
- Watch for authentication errors
- Verify file copying success rates
- Check audit logs for anomalies

## Success Criteria

- âœ… Support 3+ source repositories in single deployment
- âœ… 100% backward compatibility with existing configs
- âœ… No performance degradation for single-source use cases
- âœ… Clear documentation and migration path
- âœ… Comprehensive test coverage (target: >80%)
- âœ… Successful production deployment
