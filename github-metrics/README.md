# GitHub Metrics Tooling

This directory contains tooling to enable us to track various GitHub project metrics programmatically.

Currently, it contains a PoC for a simple pipeline to pull metrics from GitHub into MongoDB Atlas. 

Planned future work: 

- Add logic to work with pulled maintenance metrics once available in the test repo
- Set up Atlas Charts to visualize the data

## GitHub repo metrics

### Get metrics from GitHub

This is a simple PoC that uses [octokit](https://github.com/octokit/octokit.js) to get the following data out of GitHub
for a given repository over a trailing 14 day period:

- Views
- Unique Views
- Stars
- Watchers
- Forks
- Top 10 referral sources
- Top 10 paths/destinations in the repo

The intent is to also get the following maintenance-related stats for a given repository over a trailing 14 day period:

- Code frequency
- Commit count

However, at present, GitHub does not have any data cached for the test repo, so I'll iterate on this in a future version.

This code is in the `get-github-metrics.js` file.

> **Note**: The GitHub API does not provide the option to specify a date range for these metrics. The API _only_ provides
> this data for the trailing 14 day period, fixed. We'll need to re-run this job regularly, and in the future, we
> may want to set up a server to run this job since we cannot specify a date range.

### Change repos to track

This project pulls the configuration data from [repo-details.json](repo-details.json) to track the owner and repo name for repositories whose metrics we want to track.

#### Add a new repository

To add a new repository, create a new entry in the `repo-details.json` file in the following format:

```json
{
  "owner": "<repo-owner>",
  "repo": "<repo-name>"
}
```

You can get the owner and name from the repo URL: `https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>`
For example, to add the MongoDB docs-notebooks repository, you'd add the following to the `repo-details.json`:

```json
{
  "owner": "mongodb",
  "repo": "docs-notebooks"
}
```

The code handles tracking and writing to Atlas for multiple repos. Inserting a new repo automatically creates a new corresponding collection in Atlas. You will need to manually create Charts to correspond to the new collection.

### Write metrics to Atlas

This PoC uses the [MongoDB Node.js Driver](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/node/current/) to write the data to the
**Developer Docs** -> **Project Metrics** project in Atlas.

This code is in the `write-to-db.js` file.

In the future, we can set up Charts to visualize this data and share it with stakeholders.

### Run the tool

#### Prerequisites

To run the tool, you need:

**Atlas**:

- An Atlas Database User with write permissions for the **Developer Docs** -> **Project Metrics** project.
- A valid connection string for the cluster above.

Contact a member of the Developer Docs team to be added to this project and get the connection string.

**GitHub**:

- A [GitHub Personal Access Token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens) (PAT) with `repo` permissions

For this project, as a MongoDB org member, you must also auth your PAT with SSO.

**System**:

- Node.js/npm installed

#### Steps

1. **Create a `.env` file**

   Create a `.env` file that contains the following details:

   ```
   ATLAS_CONNECTION_STRING="yourConnectionString"
   GITHUB_TOKEN="yourToken"
   ```

   Replace the placeholder values with your connection string and GitHub token.

   > Note: The `.env` file is in the `.gitignore`, so no worries about accidentally committing credentials.

2. **Install the dependencies**

   From the root of the directory, run the following command to install project dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the utility**

   From the root of the directory, run the following command to run the utility:

   ```
   node --env-file=.env index.js
   ```

   You should see output similar to:

   ```
   A document was inserted into mongodb_docs-notebooks with the _id: 678197a0ffe1539ff213bd86
   ```
