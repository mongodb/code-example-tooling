The current context is a <PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE> project designed to test the
MongoDB <DRIVER> Driver code examples we show in the MongoDB documentation.

This project contains a utility to compare the actual output from running a
code example with the expected output we define. The entrypoint for that
utility is: <FILEPATH>

The current test is running a function from an example file and comparing the
output to the expected output in <FILEPATH or VAR NAME>. The test currently
shows that these things don't match, but they should match. I believe this is
due to an issue with the comparison utility implementation.

Help me debug why the comparison utility is returning false for this, and fix
any issues we find in the comparison library implementation, without making any
changes to the example file or expected output.
